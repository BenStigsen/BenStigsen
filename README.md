### Hello!

My name is Benjamin, I'm a 20 year-old hobbyist programmer, living in Denmark.

I love to learn and create! My current focus is to create small, lightweight and efficient software and tools.

I'm still trying to figure out if I want to be a game, software or web developer, or if I want to be a teacher.

#### [MobilePayAlerts](https://tearzz.itch.io/mobilepayalerts)  

**What is it?**  
An application made for Danish broadcasters, which combines the Danish payment system MobilePay, the alert widget system Streamlabs and the push notification service Pushbullet.

**Why?**  
I wanted to create a free alternative to a similar service, while also making users able to run it locally. I also released this for free. It was more of a learning project, since it was my first time creating GUI with Python.

**Details:**
  - Released 06. August 2018
  - 4300+ downloads _(as of 9. January 2021)_
  - Gets the same amount of downloads and clicks as when it was released
  - 60% of people that visit the store page, downloads MobilePayAlerts
